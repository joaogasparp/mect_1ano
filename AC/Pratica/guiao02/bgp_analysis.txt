Analysis of BGP and Routing Tables on Router2A and Router2B

1. Why routes to some networks are missing?
--------------------------------------------------
Routes to certain networks are missing in the BGP table or routing table because:

- Router2A doesn't see the 192.30.30.0/24 network from Router3 in AS1003. This is likely because Router2A has no direct BGP peering with AS1003, and Router2B hasn't passed that route to Router2A.
  
- Similarly, Router2B doesn't have a route to the 192.10.10.0/24 network (AS1001), possibly because Router2A isn't propagating the route learned from Router1 (AS1001) to Router2B via OSPF, or redistribution between BGP and OSPF is not configured properly.

2. Why some routes are valid but not chosen as best and not placed in the routing table?
---------------------------------------------------
Valid BGP routes might not be installed in the routing table due to:

- Administrative Distance (AD): BGP routes have AD of 20 for eBGP and 200 for iBGP. OSPF has a lower AD of 110. If a network is learned via both OSPF and BGP, the OSPF route will be preferred.
  
- BGP Path Attributes: BGP selects the best route based on attributes like Weight, Local Preference, AS Path, and MED.
  
- Next-Hop Unreachability: If the next-hop for a BGP route isn't reachable, BGP will not install it as the best route.

3. Next-Hop of all BGP routes and explanation of why some routes cannot be activated
--------------------------------------------------
- Router2A:
  - 192.10.10.0/24: Next-hop is 200.1.2.1 (Router1). This route is valid and installed.
  - 200.20.20.0/24: Next-hop is 0.0.0.0 (local). Valid and installed.
  
- Router2B:
  - 192.30.30.0/24: Next-hop is 200.3.2.3 (Router3). Valid and installed.
  - 192.20.1.0/24: Next-hop is 0.0.0.0 (local). Valid and installed.
  - 200.20.20.0/24: Next-hop is 0.0.0.0 (local). Valid and installed.

- Some routes are not activated because the next-hop is not reachable. For example, Router2B cannot reach 192.10.10.0/24 because it cannot reach the next-hop 200.1.2.1 via OSPF.

4. How the BGP NEXT-HOP attribute is propagated inside the AS?
--------------------------------------------------
When an eBGP-learned route enters an AS, its NEXT-HOP attribute is retained and propagated via iBGP. Internal routers must have IGP connectivity to the next-hop to activate the route. 

Summary:
- Routes to some networks are missing because BGP next-hop addresses are not reachable.
- Some routes are valid but not installed as the best because the BGP next-hop is not reachable.
- Proper IGP configuration is essential to propagate and activate BGP routes within an AS.
