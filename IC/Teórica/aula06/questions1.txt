Q: How does arithmetic encoding translate a sequence of symbols into a single number?
A: Arithmetic encoding maps a sequence of symbols into a single number by dividing the 
interval [0, 1] into subintervals, each corresponding to a symbol. The subinterval 
corresponding to the first symbol is divided into subintervals corresponding to the 
second symbol, and so on. The final subinterval corresponds to the entire sequence of
symbols. The number is then chosen from the final subinterval.

Q: What are the steps involved in encondig a sequence of symbols using arithmetic encoding?
A: The steps involved in encoding a sequence of symbols using arithmetic encoding are as
follows:
1. Initialize the interval [0, 1] and the subintervals corresponding to each symbol.
2. For each symbol in the sequence, update the interval based on the subinterval
corresponding to the symbol.
3. Repeat step 2 for each symbol in the sequence.
4. Choose a number from the final subinterval to represent the encoded sequence.

Q: How does it divide a number range based on symbol probabilities to represent
the entire sequence?
A: Arithmetic encoding divides the interval [0, 1] into subintervals based on the
probabilities of the symbols in the sequence. The size of each subinterval is
proportional to the probability of the corresponding symbol. This allows the entire
sequence to be represented by a single number chosen from the final subinterval.

Q: How can we decode a single number back into the original sequence of symbols in
arithmetic encoding?
A: To decode a single number back into the original sequence of symbols in arithmetic
encoding, we reverse the process of encoding. We start with the single number and
determine which subinterval it falls into. We then map this subinterval back to the
corresponding symbol and remove it from the number. We repeat this process until we
have decoded the entire sequence of symbols.

Q: How does arithmetic encoding depend on accurate probability models for efficient
compression?
A: Arithmetic encoding depends on accurate probability models for efficient compression
because the size of the subintervals is determined by the probabilities of the symbols
in the sequence. If the probability model is inaccurate, the subintervals may not
properly represent the sequence, leading to less efficient compression. Therefore, a
good probability model is essential for arithmetic encoding to achieve optimal
compression performance.
