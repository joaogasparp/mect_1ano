Q1. What is the relationship between modeling and coding?
A: Modeling involves creating abstract representations of systems or processes, which 
can then be used to design efficient coding schemes. Coding is the implementation of 
these models to compress or transmit data effectively.

Q2. How do probability models relate to coding efficiency?
A: Probability models help in coding efficiency by predicting the likelihood of different
symbols or sequences. This allows for the use of variable-length codes, where more probable
symbols are assigned shorter codes, thus reducing the overall length of the encoded message.

Q3: What is entropy, and how does it relate to coding?
A: Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty or randomness in a set of data. In coding,
entropy represents the minimum average number of bits needed to encode the data without
loss. Lower entropy indicates more predictable data, which can be compressed more efficiently.

Q4. What is a Markov model, and how does it help in coding?
A: A Markov model is a statistical model that predicts future states based on the current
state, assuming that the future state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence
of events that preceded it. In coding, Markov models help by providing more accurate predictions
of symbol sequences, leading to more efficient compression.

Q5. What are the trade-offs between simple probability models and more complex models like Markov
models in coding?
A: Simple probability models are easier to implement and require less computational power,
but they may not capture all the dependencies in the data, leading to less efficient coding.
More complex models like Markov models can capture more dependencies and provide better compression,
but they require more computational resources and can be more difficult to implement.
