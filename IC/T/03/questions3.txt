Q1. What is a decodable code, and why is it important in data compression?
A: A decodable code is a coding scheme where the encoded message can be uniquely decoded
back to the original message without ambiguity. Decodable codes are essential in data compression
to ensure that the compressed data can be accurately reconstructed without loss, enabling
efficient storage and transmission of information.

Q2. What is a prefix code, and how does it ensure decodability?
A: A prefix code is a type of code where no codeword is a prefix of another codeword in the
coding scheme. This property ensures that the encoded message can be uniquely decoded by
reading the codewords sequentially without ambiguity. Prefix codes guarantee decodability
by eliminating the possibility of overlapping codewords, simplifying the decoding process.

Q3. Why might we prefer prefix codes over other types od codes?
A: Prefix codes are preferred over other types of codes in data compression due to their
simplicity and efficiency in decoding. Since no codeword is a prefix of another codeword,
prefix codes can be decoded unambiguously by reading the codewords sequentially. This
simplifies the decoding process and reduces the likelihood of decoding errors, making
prefix codes more reliable and practical for data compression applications.

Q4. How does the structure of a code impact its efficiency and reliability?
A: The structure of a code, such as whether it is a prefix code or not, can significantly
impact its efficiency and reliability in data compression. Prefix codes, for example,
simplify the decoding process and ensure decodability, leading to more efficient and reliable
compression. In contrast, codes with overlapping codewords or complex structures may
require more computational resources for decoding and increase the risk of decoding errors,
affecting the overall efficiency and reliability of the compression scheme.

Q5. Can a code be decodable but not a prefix code? if so, give an example.
A: Yes, a code can be decodable but not a prefix code. An example of such a code is a
sufficiently long fixed-length code, where each symbol is encoded using the same number
of bits. While this code is decodable, it is not a prefix code because the codewords
overlap, making the decoding process ambiguous. However, with additional information
about the code structure, such as the fixed length of each codeword, the code can still
be decoded uniquely, demonstrating that decodability does not necessarily require
the prefix property.
