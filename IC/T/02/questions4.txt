Alice told Bob that she found an image compression software that is able to reduce
the size of every image in, at least, 50% of its original size - for example, if originally
the image occupies 1 000 000 bytes, after compression it will require at most 500 000 bytes.
Bob was not very impressed by Alice's statement. However, when Alice added that she would also
be able to always recover the original image from its compressed version, Bob immedlately replied:
"THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE Every lossless (I.e., reversible) compression method is limited, i.e.,
it cannot compress all messages!" Is Bob correct? Why?

R: Bob is correct in stating that every lossless compression method is limited and cannot compress all messages.
This limitation is due to the nature of lossless compression, which aims to reduce the size of data without losing
any information. In practice, lossless compression algorithms work by exploiting redundancies, patterns, or regularities
in the data to achieve compression. However, not all data can be effectively compressed using these techniques, especially
data that is highly entropic, random, or lacks any discernible patterns or redundancies.
