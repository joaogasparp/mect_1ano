Q1. What is computation?
R: Computation is the process of performing operations on data to produce a result. It involves manipulating

Q2. Are there problems that computers cannot solve?
R: Yes, there are problems that computers cannot solve. Some problems are inherently undecidable or require
infinite computational resources to solve, making them unsolvable in practice. Examples of such problems include
the halting problem, the busy beaver problem, and certain instances of the traveling salesman problem.
